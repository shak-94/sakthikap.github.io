I am currently a Software Engineer at Artian AI, where I work on developing an agent-based platform leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs). Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Machine Learning in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My research there focused on learning causality from physics simulations. Before that, I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, also at Carnegie Mellon University, with a thesis centered on using Graph Networks to learn particle dynamics and control. My journey from academia to industry has been driven by a passion for advancing artificial intelligence and its applications, bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation.
